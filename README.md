## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Cash App integrate Payment APIs?

Cash App plugin is a quick and easy way to display to your customers your CashTag and to link them to it.
Unfortunately, this plugin doesn't integrate a full CashApp end-to-end payment. It only displays your cashtag to the customer and redirects them to it so that the off site Cash App transaction can take place.

Please check screenshots for more details on what is reported.
